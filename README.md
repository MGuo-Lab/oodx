## Sumomo: Surrogate Modelling and Optimisation
Sumomo is a Python package for surrogate modelling formulating optimisation problems using *Pyomo*. Surrogate models include Gaussian processes and neural networks for regression and classification. sumomo enables an entire surrogate modelling workflow and abstracted *Pyomo* formulations to be incorporated into larger optimisation problems.

## Example
```python
import pyomo.environ as pyo
from sumomo import api
```
