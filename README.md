## sumomo: surrogate modelling and optimisation
sumomo is a Python package for surrogate modelling and *Pyomo* formulations. Surrogate models include Gaussian processes and neural networks for regression and classification. sumomo enables an entire surrogate modelling workflow followed by abstracted *Pyomo* formulations to be incorporated into larger optimisation problems.

## Example
```python
import pyomo.environ as pyo
from sumomo import api
```
